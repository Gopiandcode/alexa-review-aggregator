# Alexa Review Aggregator
With Amazon Alexa's rising popularity, brand new possibilities for interaction design are evolving as we speak. Unfortunately at the moment
Amazon doesn't provide a publicly available API for collecting data on the skills market, providing a significant barrier on entry to researchers
wanting to perform studies on voice related APIS.

The Alexa review aggregator aims to fill this hole until Amazon gets around to releasing a researcher API for aggregating data. The skill aims 
to provide a simple interface to allow researchers to collect Alexa data without hassle.

More details to follow.
