gratefull,"Gratefulness is the act of expressing gratitude and being thankful for what you have. As research suggests, practicing gratefulness daily leads to a positive outlook on life, improving your physical and emotional health. Not only that, spending some time reflecting on your day and reminding yourself of the positive events can help you sleep longer and better!

Practicing gratefulness with a notebook and pen requires additional effort in our already busy lives. This skill makes it quick and easy to build a powerful habit. Simply say: ""Alexa, start grate full."" When asked, tell Alexa what you are grateful for and don't forget to rate your day on a scale between 0 and 10 (10 being the best). That's it - you are done! It takes less than 2 minutes.

If you need help during the process, simply say, ""Alexa Help"". If something came up and you can't finish, just say ""Alexa Stop"" or ""Alexa Cancel"". All the best!"

Period Tracker,"Period Tracker will help you keep track of your menstrual cycle's phases for a better family planning.
It is loosely based on the Standard Days Method by Georgetown University, and may only be used by women whose cycles are usually between 26 and 32 days in length.

You should start by indicating the date of your last period (Day 1 of your menstrual cycle), and remember to continue to do so each period, for the calculations to work.
The skill will average your cycles duration and estimate phases accordingly.

Example uses:

- Alexa, launch Period Tracker
- I got my period today
- when is my fertile window?

- Alexa, ask Period Tracker when do i get my period?

Maybe you forget to keep your data up-to-date, so it's likely the averages and calculations are not perfect, so you can clean up everything and start over:

- Alexa, open Period Tracker
- reset my database
- i got my period on March 17th"
